# Cloud Filestore: Qwik Start


Cloud Filestore is a managed file storage service for applications that require a file system interface and a shared filesystem for data. Filestore gives users a simple, native experience for standing up managed Network Attached Storage (NAS) with their Compute Engine and Google Kubernetes Engine instances. The ability to fine-tune Filestoreâ€™s performance and capacity independently leads to predictably fast performance for your file-based workloads.
